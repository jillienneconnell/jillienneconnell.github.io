    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        I am a junior Finance and Management Information Systems (MIS) double major within the Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma. I expect to graduate May of 2025 with aspirations of attending graduate school and working in the finance industry after graduation.

        At the University of Oklahoma, I co-founded and serve as President of the Women in Finance organization. I have a passion for increasing female interest and involvement in Finance as well as camaraderie and business networking among women. I am also a part of Price College's Capital Fellows Program where I prepare for FINRA exams including the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) and the Series 7 licensing exam. Within the program, I attend on-campus speaker series and one-on-one meetings with executives from the financial services industry. Additionally, I work on staff within the Price College of Business as an MIS teaching assistant to 250+ students.
